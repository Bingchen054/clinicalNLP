# 🏥 clinicalNLP  
### Clinical Documentation Intelligence & Utilization Review System  

clinicalNLP is a production-oriented NLP system that transforms unstructured emergency department (ER) documentation into structured, severity-aware clinical intelligence.

The system combines rule-based medical signal extraction with large language model reasoning to generate audit-aligned, structured outputs suitable for utilization review workflows.

## 🚀 Core Capabilities  

### 📄 Clinical Document Ingestion
- PDF upload (ER notes, admission notes)
- Structured text extraction
- Section parsing (HPI, Vitals, Labs, Imaging, Assessment)

---

### 🧠 Medical Signal Extraction
- Diagnosis detection  
- Vital sign abnormality detection  
- Lab abnormality flagging  
- Organ dysfunction heuristics  
- Hypoxia detection  
- Severity stratification  

---

### 🤖 LLM Reasoning Layer  

Model used:

```
Llama-3.3-70B-Versatile
```

The LLM functions as a structured reasoning engine to:

- Synthesize clinical severity  
- Differentiate moderate vs critical instability  
- Generate admission-level justification summaries  
- Maintain consistent, schema-validated outputs  

The LLM layer is abstracted behind a service module and operates within a deterministic pipeline.

## 🧩 Hybrid Design  

clinicalNLP does not rely solely on generative output.

It combines:

- Rule-based clinical heuristics  
- Deterministic signal construction  
- Structured LLM reasoning  
- Output schema enforcement  

This reduces hallucination risk and maintains consistent formatting suitable for regulated medical environments.

## 🧪 Representative Test Cases  

The system has been validated on structured ER documentation samples.

---

### Case 1 – Severe Hypoxic Pneumonia  

Source: ER Notes 31137171 B :contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}  

Key findings:

- 82-year-old male from nursing facility  
- O2 saturation 88–90% on room air  
- Bilateral infiltrates on CXR  
- Acute respiratory failure  
- Elevated BUN 49, Creatinine 1.7  
- Required supplemental oxygen  
- 31 minutes documented critical care time  

System behavior:

- Detects acute hypoxic respiratory failure  
- Flags organ dysfunction risk  
- Generates inpatient-level medical necessity reasoning  
- Amplifies severity signals appropriately  

---

### Case 2 – Right Lower Lobe Pneumonia (Moderate Severity)  

Source: ER Notes 31139309 A :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}  

Key findings:

- 82-year-old female  
- Right lower lobe pneumonia  
- Initially stable vitals  
- Oxygen desaturation requiring 2L nasal cannula  
- WBC 12.4  
- Mild metabolic abnormalities  

System behavior:

- Differentiates moderate vs critical instability  
- Identifies developing hypoxia  
- Generates structured admission rationale  
- Avoids overstatement of organ failure
